I've implemented the Blockchain as a doubly linked list where each node contains a Block. If we consider the number of inputs (blocks) as n, appending a Block to the Blockchain is of **O(1)** time, because we're keeping track of the tail of the linked list. The costliest computation is verifying the Blockchain, which involves going over each Block to make sure its data has not been modified after creation (**O(n)** time). The space complexity of the Blockchain is also **O(n)**.
