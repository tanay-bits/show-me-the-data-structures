I've implemented the Blockchain as a doubly linked list where each node contains a Block. Creation of a Block takes O(n) time, where n is the size of the input data. This comes from the time to calculate its SHA256 hash digest. Adding a Block to the Blockchain is O(1) time, because we're keeping track of the tail of the linked list. The costliest computation is verifying the Blockchain, which involves going over each Block to make sure its data has not been modified after creation. This takes **O(n^2)** time because for each Block we have to compute the hash value again.
