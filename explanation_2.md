This task is solved by recursion, since it can be broken down into smaller tasks which are similar to the main task. To find all files ending with a particular suffix beneath a path, we need to check if the files at this level meet that criteria, and if any files beneath any of the subdirectories meet that criteria. Now each subdirectory can be considered the "main" directory in a recursive step. We recurse until we have explored all files and subdirectories, so the time complexity is **O(number of recursive calls * work done at every level)** or **O(n)**, where n is the total number of files and subdirectories beneath the input directory, since work done at every level is of constant time.
